# Serpent-BTP

This repository contains a minimal terminal-based Snake game.

## Requirements

The game relies only on Python's standard library `curses` module. On Windows, install the optional `windows-curses` package:

```bash
pip install windows-curses
```

## Running the game

Run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
python3 snake_game.py
```

Use the arrow keys to control the snake. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.
